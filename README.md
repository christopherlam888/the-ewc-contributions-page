A web app for users to easily contribute new entries to The EWC app glossary. 

## Contributing
- NOTE: Currently the contributions page can only be run alongside a local instance of the backend server with write permissions - Contributing is on hold until a new instance of the server with appropriate permissions is deployed
- Please check the current glossary to make sure the term you would like to add hasn't already been added.
- Follow proper capitalization and punctuation.
- Leave the img field blank. Adding images to the glossary app is planned but not yet implemented.

## Features To Implement
- Contributing instructions
- Input validation
- UI improvements
